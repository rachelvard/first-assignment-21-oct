## Why I Am Taking This Class
- Facing my Fears - Having approached statistical software which required coding in the past, and really struggled, I decided to change mindset and face my fears. And atually committing to improve that weak spot has actually turned that fear around.
- Career Crossroads - My job ceased to exist in the summer. This gave me time to study and some money to put towards career development. 
- Meet my Goals -  Once I considered  of learning coding for data analytics, I decided on this class (after weeks of vacillation) because I felt I could learn a lot in a scheduled and collaborate environment.

## My Favourite Things
- Halloween - Always loved spooky things and its the absolute the best holiday to celebrate with your kid
- Caffeine- not original but still true (plus rhymes with Halloween)
- The Sea - even the freezing Irish sea will do!

## Professional Background
- Spent five years as an ESG Analyst with a ratings company, assessing sustainability practices of energy, waste and water companies. 
- Two years as a product safety consultant, running research projects to assess product safety of client's projects
- MSc Sustainable Development - University of Surrey
- MSc Bioengineering - Trinity College Dublin 


## Previous Experiences With Coding
- Have extremely limited exposure to R and Matlab as part of postgrad studies, but had never been exposed to code prior- so only used what was required to look competent

## Fun Facts
- One of the original member of the Waterford City Viqueens roller derby team
- I have done a lot of different things in my career- in my Bioengineering course, I ended up spending six months in a lab making synthetic bone and culturing cells who lived on it. Before that I had an internship at a factory which made board games.
