**Why I Am Taking This Class
- Facing my Fears - Having approached statistical software which required coding in the past, and really struggled, I decided to change mindset and face my fears. And atually committing to improve that weak spot has actually turned that fear around.
- Career Crossroads - My job ceased to exist in the summer. This gave me time to study and some money to put towards career development. 
- Meet my Goals -  Once I considered  of learning coding for data analytics, I decided on this class (after weeks of vacillation) because I felt I could learn a lot in a scheduled and collaborate environment.

**My Favourite Things
- Halloween - Always loved spooky things and its the absolute the best holiday to celebrate with your kid
- Caffeine- not original but still true (plus rhymes with Halloween)

**Professional Background

**Previous Experiences With Coding
- Have extremely limited exposure to R and Matlab as part of postgrad studies, but had never been exposed to code- so only used what was required to look competent
